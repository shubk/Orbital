# Orbital
Beauty of orbital equation for satellite positioning
Write a pair of classes in Java that meets the following specs: 
1. A Rectangle contains and manages typical things about a rectangle. It has four sides and four vertices, and you can call methods to find its height, width, area, perimeter and corner coefficients, write essential info about the Rectangle to an output stream OS.
 2. A Plat is a rectangle that's at a particular place on the earth. So, it inherits from Rectangle but also has some variables for real
 world location. It should have methods that return the area and perimeter in real-world units. 
Finally,  Plat should have a variable for average altitude, though you don't need to populate it at this point. How you handle the conversion from the abstract Rectangle to real-world units is up to you. Your classes should to have proper constructors.
1: overload the operator appropriately to support sorting by area.
 2: add variables and methods to allow Plats to be at an angle to the equator
